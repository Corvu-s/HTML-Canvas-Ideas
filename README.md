## The Thingking Background
I wanted to replicate an effect I noticed from a video from a popular youtube Coder and gamer Sethbling.
[Here at 1:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipi40cb_RsI). From the video, you can see the cool Mario Kart ai visualizations he made, so I wanted to replicate the visual style.

## Nodes
This was a beginner project from [Chris Courses](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9Yp2yz6-pwhQuPlIDV_mjA) on youtube. The connections between nodes were an afterthought by me.I was inspired by other animations that have similar effects.

## The Matrix
What can I say, it's the 'raining code' form the matrix. Not quite a perfect replica but it's a work in progress
